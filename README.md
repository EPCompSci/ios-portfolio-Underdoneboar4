### About Blake Branvold
this is the very first app I made. It served as my introduction to outlet functions, action functions, labels, buttons, and the Assets folder. 

### 5DiceRoller
I consider this to be the very first "real" app I made. It functions exactly like Yahtzee, where you shake the phone and can choose to roll or not roll some dice by tapping them. I checked for a Yahtzee (all five dice are the same) or for what I called "at least one pair". In the game Yahtzee one pair is the lowest point value, and I have already programmed a fully working Yahtzee game in java, so I figured adding in the rest of the scoring logic (full house, straights, etc.) would be a poor use of class time. I learned about and became proficient at changing some button and label properties (specifically, the text in labels and images in buttons) and comparing those properties. This project was also my introduction to proper UI design and application icon making.

### Eggs With Legs
[Eggs with Legs](https://github.com/chauphana/Eggs-with-Legs)
This is the project I spent the most time on. In the span of around 9 weeks, two people and myself made a Plants-vs-Zombies style game where different types of eggs move towards a fence with a limited amount of health. The user taps the eggs to destroy them, and tries to survive until that wave ends, and then they can spend coins they earned in a shop before the next wave starts. I mainly worked on the following three areas of the project: sprite creation, sound design / implementation, and testing. My sprite work can be found [Here](https://www.piskelapp.com/user/6081587725205504). I made 


Create links to group projects (create a new repo for completed apps) you've been working on, making sure the read me's have details about what the apps do in the format the app store asks - look at a couple apps to see what I'm talking about. Don't forget about those first simple apps you created - they still matter!
