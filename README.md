2018-2020 Portfolio for Blake Branvold

### About Me (Not an App)
My name is Blake Branvold, and this is my portfolio of everything I made in my 2018-2019 (and 2019-2020) iOS and Advanced iOS Development classes at Eden Prairie High School. You can download all of my 2018-2019 projects at once (excluding projects too large to fit) by downloading this portfolio, or you can view them individually by going to the links located below. Thank you for looking through some of my work as a high schooler.

## 2018-2019

### About Blake Branvold
[About Blake Branvold](https://github.com/Underdoneboar4/About-Blake-Branvold)
This is the very first app I made. It displays different images and text when buttons are pressed. It served as my introduction to outlet functions, action functions, labels, buttons, and the Assets folder. 

### 5DiceRoller
[5DiceRoller](https://github.com/Underdoneboar4/5DiceRoller)
I consider this to be the very first "real" app I made. It functions exactly like Yahtzee, where you shake the phone and can choose to roll or not roll some dice by tapping them. I checked for a Yahtzee (all five dice are the same) or for what I called "at least one pair". In the game Yahtzee one pair is the lowest point value, and I have already programmed a fully working Yahtzee game in java, so I figured adding in the rest of the scoring logic (full house, straights, etc.) would be a poor use of class time. I learned about and became proficient at changing some button and label properties (specifically, the text in labels and images in buttons) and comparing those properties. This project was also my introduction to proper UI design and application icon making.

### Eggs With Legs
[Eggs with Legs](https://github.com/chauphana/Eggs-with-Legs)
This is the project I spent the most time on. In the span of around 9 weeks, two people and myself made a Plants-vs-Zombies style game where different types of eggs move towards a fence with a limited amount of health. The user taps the eggs to destroy them, and tries to survive until that wave ends, and then they can spend coins they earned in a shop before the next wave starts. I mainly worked on the following three areas of the project: sprite creation, sound design / implementation, and testing. My sprite work can be found [Here](https://www.piskelapp.com/user/6081587725205504). I made many songs and sounds for this app, which sadly aren't as easy to group together. I also handled the playing of sound throughout the app, and eventually consolidated the playing of sound into a single class. Throughout development, I also found groups of people to test new features on, gather their reccomendations for inprovements, and boil them down to what would be feasible / good to implement. We all also worked on general game design / reward systems / enemy types / progression. 

### FootballFinder
[FootballFinder](https://github.com/Underdoneboar4/FootballFinder)
This started out as a side project that I would work on during down time for Eggs with Legs. It takes the user's coordinates, and tells them the closest professional football team to them. My biggest area of learning in this side project involved permissions and the modifications to the Info.plist file needed for permissions to work. This project was also my introduction to location and coordinates, and finding the closest football team when coordinates were used proved to be an interesting challenge.

### EPHS
[EPHS](https://github.com/EPCompSci/EagleNation) 

NOTE: Only people associated with the project have access. Please search for "EPHS Student" on the iOS App Store to see it

This was my second large project of the class. I made a portion of the large EPHS (Eden Prairie High School) app I referred to as "TimePasser" that serves as the home screen for the app. It lists the current time down to the second, and says how many minutes there are until the current class ends / the next class starts. Developing this was quite a challenge as Eden Prairie High School has a few different types of schedules can be used, and adjusting times accordingly proved harder thn initially thought. Eventually the decision was made to switch it to a database-driven app, which served as a good introduction to databases for me. While developing TimePasser, I learned much about how Swift handles times and dates, and how to properly read, set, and change dates and times based on the internal clock of a device. I also learned how to compare times and set items into chronological order.

### Stats Capstone Data Collector
[Stats Capstone Data Collector](https://github.com/Underdoneboar4/Stats-Capstone-Data-Collector)
This project was for my AP Statisics class. Read below in the genericized version of the app for a better description of what this app does. Trust me, it'll make more sense in the context of the generic version. For this app, I learned how to make an aggreable UI, as shoving this screen in people's faces was the only real way to collect data in the study I was running.

### StatisticsDataCollector
[StatisticsDataCollector](https://github.com/Underdoneboar4/StatisticsDataCollector)
This is the generic version of my Capstone app above. Upon opening, the user is directed to press a button. Once the button is pressed, a pop-up appears asking for a question and a left / right option. Once given, they appear and let the user present the app to people they want to collect data from on a subject. The subject presses a button, and that button press is logged, and sampling without replacement is enured by a switch that will be flipped off by a subject if they have been sampled before, and their data will be recorded differently. Tapping "END" will show how much each button has been tapped, and tapping "BCK" will return to the question-and-answer portion. I learned a lot about making pop-ups appear and general tidying up of code / variables.

### QuizMaker
[QuizMaker](https://github.com/Underdoneboar4/QuizMaker)
WARNING! THIS APP IS INCOMPLETE (barely)
I wanted to make an app where a user could make their own multiple choice quizzes, where the answers would be displayed in the end. To add extra challenge, I also wanted this app to only be in one view, making me be more efficient with my code and variables. The user starts by entering how many questions they want to be asked, then will enter their questions and 4 possible answers per question. Then the screen goes nearly blank and is to be given to the quiz taker. The quiz taker is then to answer the questions that pop up. Sadly, there is some sort of logic error in my code that does not allow for a made quiz to be completed properly, but it is otherwise completely functional. The only restriction keeping this app from being finished is how much class time is left, which is none. I plan on someday revisiting this app and finally finishing it up. I learned quite a lot while developing this app. My challenge to myself to limit this app to one screen helped me find new ways to conserve screen space and selectively hide / show / repurpose labels and text fields. This app was also one of my greatest logic challenges, deciding what to do every time the "next" button was pressed took a lot of consideration. 

### LEDAlphabetMorse
[LEDAlphabetMorse](https://github.com/Underdoneboar4/LEDAlphabetMorse)
WARNING! THIS IS NOT AN IPHONE APP AND IS FOR ARDUINO
This program is another one I made in my spare time. It takes a String, and when put in the WordEater method it blinks out the String in Morse Code on any connected LED you want. Morse Code was boiled down to dits and dots, according to a changeable TimeUnit.

### ResistorCalculator
[ResistorCalculator](https://github.com/Underdoneboar4/ResistorCalculator)
WARNING! THIS IS NOT AN IPHONE APP AND IS IN JAVA
This program is another one I made in my spare time. Through a series of prints and user imputs, it is able to determine the nominal value and a +-5% tolerance for an electrical resistor when the color bands of said resistor are given.

## 2019-2020
Please note: the 2019-2020 session is still ongoing

### Brightside
[Brightside](https://github.com/VarunSaini02/Brightside)
This app was made with the intent to fulfill a class tradition. A few minutes before class ended, we would play a song that would end as the bell rang, as a way to be able to reach a proper stopping point. Last year, it was done manually. This app does it automatically, using notifications and a song cut into bits that can fit in a notification. playing one after the other. The user can do things like set the song to play at a certain time (including a hard-coded end of class) or right away. I learned much more about Date objects through this project and got even more experience with them since my work on EPHS. Audio and permissions were other areas of learning for me during this project. 

### Metronome
[Metronome](https://github.com/Underdoneboar4/Metronome)
Metronome was made mostly for fun. It can detect BPM from someone tapping, play an animation and sound based on a selected BPM, and functions well, aside from higher BPM's making it so that playing the sound every beat doesn't work because of the sound's length. I learned a lot about sound and timing in Xcode with this project, along with sliders, which I had never worked with before. Finding image and sound sources was a bit of a challenge, and the current assets may be changed soon.

### Rush Hour
[Rush Hour](https://github.com/VarunSaini02/Rush-Hour)
Rush Hour is a work-in-progress simulation of the board game that goes by the same name. This project will involve a lot of storyboard and controller interactions, as the game is based on many image views whose image signify which piece type is occupying a space.

### Bingo Card
[Bingo Card](https://github.com/Underdoneboar4/-BingoCard)
My first solo project of the semester, Bingo Card simulates a bingo card, as the name implies. This was born form the Rush Hour project, and serves as more of a proof-of-concept at this stage due to the sheer volume of images needed to display the bingo numbers. My main learnings were with more behind-the-scenes work, like figuring out how to number every space properly with recursion and naming variables well to keep it coherent.
